# Who am I?
I am a some time automotive engineer, computer scientist and racing driver.

# Education
I've been to university twice, the first time to get a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Bristol and the second time an MEng in Automotive Engineering from the University of Bath. 

Computer Science was great, but sadly once I realised that there just wasn't as much fun stuff to do in the real world as there was at university I got a little disheartened (I loved architecture lectures, building emulators and compilers). I decided that I wanted to do something applying my computer knowledge, not just work in a hardware or software firm and so looked around for some inspiration, landing on my other passion, motorsport.

Studying automotive engineering was brilliant. I'd always had an interest in cars and a passion for motorsport and at Bath I got heavily involved in the Formula Student team. If you are even contemplating doing engineering at university, look for somewhere which competes in Formula Student because nothing beats being part of a team building and running your own racing car!

# Motorsport
Alongside studying for my MEng I was also attempting to forge a career as a racing driver (as one does). I competed in British Formula Ford for 3 years, Northern European Formula Renault for a year and the Porsche Carrera Cup GB for a year. I also made occasional outings in an Aston GT4, including a class win in the Silverston Britcar 24HR, probably my career highlight. Sadly the real world caught up with me and while I'd love to make a return, for the moment I've hung up my boots.

# Employment
With degrees in engineering and computing and my racing background, I managed to find a job as a Simulation Software Engineer at Red Bull Formula 1 Team. This was both an amazing opportunity and a huge challenge. I was one of several software engineers within the simulation group, dedicated to developing infrastructure and tools to support desktop and cluster simulations, driver in the loop simulators and strategy simulations. Not to mention getting to drive the simulator on shake down days, I think quite possibly the greatest job perk there will ever be!

I left Red Bull in 2015 to move to Jersey with my wife who is a linguist and budding lawyer and am still working out what my next challenge will be.

# Interests
I'm your pretty standard software geek, I love reading about new and interesting programming languages, software tools, libraries, techniques, etc. I spend far too much time on my computer just reading and so this blog is an attempt to share interesting things with the world and act as a nudge to make be learn a little deeper and have a less fleeting attention span.
