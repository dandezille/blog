title: "Motivation & Focus"
---

My main intention when starting to write was to give myself an outlet and some motivation to dive into interesting topics a 
little more deeply. Well that's not gone too well so far! The way I see it, I have two problems, motivation and focus, neither of which
I seem to be able to muster in coordination...

I thought I'd put into writing the topics I actually find interesting and would like to know more about, then when I'm feeling like
I don't know what to work on, I can just refer back.
