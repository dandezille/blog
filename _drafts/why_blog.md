title: "Why Blog?"

So why am I writing a blog? 

Reason number one is that I spend far too much of my time poking about on the internet, reading interesting things, solving problems in personal projects, testing and exploring ideas and technologies and end with with little beyond snippets of code in my Dropbox to show for it. I want to try and write up some of these experiments and investigations to help myself learn more deeply and also to give something back to the community. If no-one on the internet wrote, my life would be much less interesting. I hope by attempting to write myself I may give something back, show someone something interesting or maybe my crappy writing will just give someone else the confidence to lend their voice to the community without feeling self conscious.

Reason number two, is that I enjoy writing! I'm not sure why, I'm rather quiet in person if you ever meet me but there's all sorts going on inside my head and I find writing a great way to get those thoughts in order. I can also tend to ramble so I'm hoping by having somewhere to practice I can tighten up my writing skills.

Who knows, one day someone may find something useful here...
